## User Stories

In addition to the current user stories, here are the proposed additional user stories:

### Users

1. As a **user**, I want to be able to **log in using SSO** so that I can **access the application** without having to create an account.
2. As a **user** I want to be able to have **different roles in different projects** so that I can **have varying levels of privilege and responsibility** under different projects.

### Todos

1. As a **user**, I want to be able to **attach files to todos** so that I can **share relevant information in various formats** with other users.
2. As a **user**, I want to be able to **assign todos to multiple users** so that I can **collaborate with others** on the same task.

### Notifications

1. As a **user**, I want to be able to **customise the notification settings** so that I can **receive notifications in the way that suits me**.
2. As a **user**, I want to be able to **receive notifications in-app** so that I can **stay informed** abouut important events pertaining to my tasks.
3. As a **user**, I want to be able to **receive notifications via email** so that I can **stay informed** without opening the application.
4. As a **user**, I want to be able to **receive notifications via push notifications** so that I **be reminded of important information** without opening the application or my email.
5. As a **user**, I want to be able to **mark notifications as read** so that I can **avoid being reminded of them** in the future.
6. As a **user**, I want to **see a chronologically ordered list of notifications** so that I can **keep track of the latest information** about my tasks.
